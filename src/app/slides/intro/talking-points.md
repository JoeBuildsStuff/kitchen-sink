# How AI Might Impact Banking: Lessons from 25 Years of Automation

## The Core Question
**How might AI impact banking?** To answer this, let's examine how automation has already transformed the industry over the past 25 years.

## Banking's Fundamental Role
Banks serve as intermediaries that:
- **Protect deposits** and provide security for savers
- **Provide loans** to support economic growth and development
- **Create markets** between borrowers and savers, facilitating capital flow

## The Transformation: 2000 vs 2025

### The Banking Landscape Then and Now

**2000: The Traditional Model**
- **10,102 banks** serving the market
- **$7.2 trillion** in total assets
- **1.9 million employees** (0.68% of US population)
- **Net Interest Margin: 3.82%**

**2025: The Automated Era**
- **4,421 banks** (56% fewer institutions)
- **$25.0 trillion** in total assets (3.5x growth)
- **2.1 million employees** (0.60% of US population)
- **Net Interest Margin: 3.23%** (15% compression)

### Key Insights from the Data

**1. Efficiency Through Consolidation**
- **Fewer banks, more assets**: 56% fewer institutions managing 3.5x more assets
- **Higher productivity**: Assets per employee increased from $3.76M to $12.12M (223% increase)

**2. The Labor Paradox**
- **Fewer bankers per citizen**: From 0.68% to 0.60% of population (-11%)
- **But higher compensation**: Average salary increased from $26,257 to $70,715 (169% increase)
- **Labor costs as % of expenses**: Increased from 42% to 49% of noninterest income

**3. Margin Compression**
- **Net Interest Margin decline**: From 3.82% to 3.23% (59 basis points)
- **Efficiency gains**: Efficiency ratio improved from 58.79% to 56.03%
- **But profitability maintained**: ROA remained stable at ~1.14%

## What This Tells Us About AI's Impact

**The automation story shows us:**

1. **Technology creates efficiency** - fewer people can manage more assets
2. **But it doesn't eliminate human value** - remaining workers are more highly compensated
3. **Competition drives margin compression** - benefits flow to customers
4. **Scale becomes critical** - smaller institutions struggle to compete

**For AI specifically, we can expect:**
- Further consolidation and efficiency gains
- Higher-skilled, better-paid banking professionals
- Continued margin pressure as AI reduces costs
- New opportunities for personalized financial services
- Enhanced risk management and fraud detection

## The Bottom Line
Just as automation transformed banking from 2000 to 2025, AI will likely accelerate these trends while creating new opportunities for those who adapt. The question isn't whether AI will impact bankingâ€”it's how quickly and effectively institutions can harness it to serve customers better.
